    "## What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. __Arthur Samuel__ described it as: \"the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.\" This is an older, informal definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Tom Mitchell__ provides a more modern definition: \"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: playing checkers.\n",
    "\n",
    "    E = the experience of playing many games of checkers\n",
    "    T = the task of playing checkers.\n",
    "    P = the probability that the program will win the next game.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.\n",

    "\n",

    "Machine Learning is a latest buzzword floating around. It desrves to, as it is one of the most interesting subfield of Computer Science.\n",
    "What does Machine Learning really means?\n",
    "Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence(AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.\n",
    "Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themsleves.\n",
    "The process of learning begins with data, such as, direct experience, or instruction, in order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide. The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust actions accordingly. \n",

    "__Data Science Goals and Deliverables__\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\tPrediction (predict a value based on inputs)\n",
    "\t\tClassification (e.g., spam or not spam)\n",
    "\t\tRecommendations (e.g., Amazon and Netflix recommendations)\n",
    "\t\tPattern detection and grouping (e.g., classification without known classes)\n",
    "\t\tAnomaly detection (e.g., fraud detection)\n",
    "\t\tRecognition (image, text, audio, video, facial, …)\n",
    "\t\tActionable insights (via dashboards, reports, visualizations, …)\n",
    "\t\tAutomated processes and decision-making (e.g., credit card approval)\n",
    "\t\tScoring and ranking (e.g., FICO score)\n",
    "\t\tSegmentation (e.g., demographic-based marketing)\n",
    "\t\tOptimization (e.g., risk management)\n",
    "\t\tForecasts (e.g., sales and revenue)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these is intended to address a specific goal and/or solve a specific problem. The real question is which goal, and whose goal is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a data scientist may think that his goal is to create a high performing prediction engine. The business that plans to utilize the prediction engine, on the other hand, may have the goal of increasing revenue, which can be achieved by using this prediction engine.\n",

    "1.\tWhenever traffic on the road then do not cross the road. So basically if you got hit by bike while crossing and your age was 6 or 5-year-old. Hence now you become older and safely you can say that when you have to cross the road.  So last many year, you brain were learning, when you should cross the road, when light is green. So brain learn from experience, so that is called about machine learning.\n",
    "2.\tML is writing algo/formula in such a way that it learns from Data itself rather that you tell to data what has to do.\n",
    "3.\tWhenever you want to cross the road, you are not thinking that, right side you have 11 cars and left side 2, so you have to cross. No brain automatically will start calculating biased on earlier experience and start making judgment.\n",

    "In supervised learning, we are given a data set and already know what our correct output should look like, having the idea that there is a relationship between the input and the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning problems are categorized into \"regression\" and \"classification\" problems. In a regression problem, we are trying to predict results within a continuous output, meaning that we are trying to map input variables to some continuous function. In a classification problem, we are instead trying to predict results in a discrete output. In other words, we are trying to map input variables into discrete categories.\n",
