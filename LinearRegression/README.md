## Linear Regression 

#### Case Study -1 ( Adverstising )


![image.png](image/Case_study_1.png)
The dataset contains statistics about the sales of a product in 200 different markets, together with advertising budgets in each of these markets for different media channels: TV, radio and newspaper. The sales are in thousands of units and the budget is in thousands of dollars.

I have here a deeper look at the data and what it means to apply a regression model to it.

I will try to find many question on this case study 
* Is there a relationship between advertising sales and budget?
* How strong is that relationship?
* Which ad types contribute to sales?
* What is the effect of each ad type of sales?
* Given ad spending in a particular market, can sales be predicted?
* Is linear regression a high variance/low bias model, or a low variance/high bias model?
* Hypothesis Testing and p-values
* Handling Categorical Features with Two Categories
And many so on....

#### Case Study -2 ( Car Price Prediction )

I have here a deeper look at the data and what it means to apply a regression model to it.

I will try to find many question on this case study care price prediction
* Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a car.
* How well those variables describe the price of a car.
* Is the price of a correlated to engine horsepower?
* Can we estimate car price based on engine horsepower?
* How strong is the relationship?

__Business Goal__
Model the price of cars with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. So business can accordingly manipulate the design of the cars, the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.

And many so on....
